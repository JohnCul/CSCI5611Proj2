<h2>Cloth Simulation</h2>
<img height=400 width="auto" src="./images/clothgif.gif">
<p>For the cloth simulation I created a 3D simulation of a cloth falling over a ball and deforming. It's slower
    than realtime and doesn't bounce as well as the in-class python example did, and I'm not sure why. I tried everything;
    smaller and larger k's with smaller and larger gravities, changing the restlen, changing the number of nodes; and nothing
    made the cloth bouncier. Because of this, I didn't implement drag because I felt it would only make the simulation less
    realistic or slower. I implemented a camera, directional and ambient lighting, and normals to create a 3D render. The normals are done correctly with cross products,
    but the triangles of the cloth still have edges in the simulation. 
</p>

<p>I only used the processing library for this part of the project. I mostly ran into problems with translating the python
    code from lecture into processing so that it worked. The fact that processing y is flipped (negative is upwards) threw me off for
    both the cloth simulation and the shallow water equation simulation. A problem I wasn't able to figure out was the cloth elasticity and
    bendiness. I couldn't get it to fall accurately, especially as it reached the vertical plane. It slows down and stops before it crosses the plane
    instead of hitting the bottom with full velocity and bending. I looked through the algorithm many times and could not find a solution to fix
    this. I did not add user interaction, ripping, or air drag. I had a very busy week preparing for three exams and couldn't make any progress
    on fixing the falling speed issue since Monday.
