<h2>Cloth Simulation</h2>

<p>For the cloth simulation I created a 3D simulation of a cloth falling over a ball and deforming. It's slower
    than realtime and doesn't bounce as well as the in-class python example did, and I'm not sure why. I tried everything;
    smaller and larger k's with smaller and larger gravities, changing the restlen, changing the number of nodes; and nothing
    made the cloth bouncier. Because of this, I didn't implement drag because I felt it would only make the simulation less
    realistic or slower. I implemented a camera, directional and ambient lighting, and normals to create a 3D render. The normals are done correctly with cross products,
    but the triangles of the cloth still have edges in the simulation. 
</p>

<p>I only used the processing library for this part of the project. I mostly ran into problems with translating the python
    code from lecture into processing so that it worked. The fact that processing y is flipped (negative is upwards) threw me off for
    both the cloth simulation and the shallow water equation simulation. A problem I wasn't able to figure out was the cloth elasticity and
    bendiness. I couldn't get it to fall accurately, especially as it reached the vertical plane. It slows down and stops before it crosses the plane
    instead of hitting the bottom with full velocity and bending. I looked through the algorithm many times and could not find a solution to fix
    this. I did not add user interaction, ripping, or air drag. I had a very busy week preparing for three exams and couldn't make any progress
    on fixing the falling speed issue since Monday.

<h2>Shallow Water</h2>
<img height=400 width="auto" src="./images/watergif.gif">
<p>I created a shallow water equation simulation based on the pseudocode we learned in class. The simulation has 30 boxes that change
    height based on the equation, using midpoint helpers and eulerian integration to find the next values for each i. The endpoints of the
    simulation use reflective boundary conditions, making the simulation more stable. I colored each of the rectangles based on the height, 
    with the taller boxes getting a deeper blue color. I used only processing libraries for this code.
</p>
<p>The largest struggle with this part of the project was getting the simulation to be in any way stable. The fact that "up" in processing is actually
    negative y made a few things difficult to figure out initially. Also, I noticed that after 20 seconds or so the simulation would become unstable and 
    explode, so I had to add code at the start of each loop that changed each hu[i] value to itself % 100. The values were getting so large that the simulation
    was breaking, so "normalizing" the array fixed the problem at some expense of realistic water flow.
